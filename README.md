# TODO:
- create an account system
- quit prompt
- create methods that checks whether an id exists, etc (error handling)
- create id's (currently client id is set to 0 and auction id increments for each created auction)
- add strating price
- reserved price is lower that the starting price (to keep the profit secured)
- organise tokens in buyer prompts

# questions
- how do auctions really work??
    - single item is a single auction
- how to decide on client and auction id's
