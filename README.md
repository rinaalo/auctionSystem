# TODO:

- determine winner
- create id's (currently client id is set to 0 and auction id increments for each created auction)
- check if a specified item id exists
- check if a specified auction id exists
- add strating price
- reserved price is lower that the starting price (to keep the profit secured)

# questions
- how do auctions really work??
    - single item is a single auction
- how to decide on client and auction id's
