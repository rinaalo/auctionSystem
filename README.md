# TODO:
- i dont think in bid the client should specify the item, the system determines which item they will be matched with
- create an account system
- quit prompt
- create methods that checks whether an id exists, etc (error handling)
- create id's (currently client id is set to 0 and auction id increments for each created auction)
- add strating price
- reserved price is lower that the starting price (to keep the profit secured)
- organise tokens in buyer prompts

# PLAN:
## Friday
- finish all auction types, work on the menu
- what the fuck is a starting price
## Saturday
- if friday task not done, continue doing that
- work on account system
## Sunday
- work on account system
- try to finish up
- test if everythings fine
- prepare questions to ask june on monday

# QUESTIONS:
- how do auctions really work??
    - single item is a single auction
- how to decide on client and auction id's
